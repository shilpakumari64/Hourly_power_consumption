# PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Analysis

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Analysis project. This project focuses on analyzing the hourly energy consumption data provided by PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), a regional transmission organization in the United States. The objective is to gain insights into energy consumption trends and build a model to predict energy consumption.

## Business Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the hourly energy consumption data from PJM and derive valuable insights. Additionally, we aim to develop a model that can predict energy consumption based on historical data. The insights and predictions obtained can help in various decision-making processes related to energy management and resource planning.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of hourly power consumption data from PJM, measured in megawatts (MW). The data is sourced from PJM's website and covers regions served by the Eastern Interconnection grid, including parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. It's important to note that data availability may vary for different regions and dates.

## Objectives and Key Questions

The project aims to address the following objectives and answer key questions:

1. Model Development: Can we build a model using historical data to predict energy consumption accurately? Splitting the dataset into a test set, we can evaluate the model's performance and its ability to forecast energy consumption.

2. Trends in Energy Consumption: Are there noticeable trends in energy consumption based on the hour of the day, holidays, or long-term trends? By analyzing the data, we can identify patterns and understand the factors influencing energy consumption.

3. Seasonal Variations: How do daily consumption trends change with different times of the year? Specifically, we expect to observe significant differences between summer and winter trends due to varying energy demands during these seasons.

4. Energy Consumption Forecast: Can we forecast energy consumption for the next 30 days? By leveraging historical data and predictive modeling techniques, we aim to provide forecasts that can assist in planning and decision-making processes.

## Approach

To address the objectives and answer the key questions, we will follow these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, and converting relevant features to appropriate formats.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of energy consumption, identify trends, and detect seasonality patterns.

3. Model Development: Build a predictive model using appropriate techniques such as time series analysis, regression, or machine learning algorithms. Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4. Trend Analysis: Analyze the data to identify trends in energy consumption based on the hour of the day, holidays, and long-term patterns. Visualizations and statistical analysis can help in revealing insights.

5. Seasonal Variation Analysis: Compare daily consumption trends between different times of the year, focusing on summer and winter seasons. Identify and quantify the differences in energy demands during these periods.

6. Energy Consumption Forecast: Utilize the developed model to forecast energy consumption for the next 30 days. Evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts and provide insights into future energy demands.
